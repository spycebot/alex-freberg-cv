# Web Curriculum Vitae after Alex "The Analyst" Freberg

04 MAR 2025

## Summary

Do it right this time. Unemployment is a fate worse than death, and it can only be remediated by the proper contextualisation of marketable skills, as well as application to the task of staying abreast of market trends and directions.

### Problem

Unemployment is a fate worse than death, that lacks both social and fiscal credit. Never be more talented than what the market can bear, and always be ready to go with what is current, rather than what you think you are good at. 

The more niche your previous role, the greater danger you are in.

### Data

This is not meta. This is an earnest attempt to reconstruct the history of computing within myself, and thus provide a clear narrative that explains how we got here. 

The way ahead is as follows.

### Analysis

Increased costs have resulted from increased web traffic, which is a leading indicator of marketing reach.

### Model

Flask is a free, low opinion, micro-web framework. As with the rest of the Python ecosystem, the documentation is not robust. However, with the assistance of code-generating AI, and a little luck, you can probably build what you are looking to build.

### Discussion

At present, we have implemented the rendering of markdown to HTML in a way that does not allow us to serve multiple pages served thusly. At this stage our own lack of internal documentation is proving to be a real source of anxiety, and must be rectified going forward.

### Conclusion

While coding and offering free web services are fun, the task at hand is much more pragmatic than simply acquiring new skills. They must be marketable, merchantable skills. To this end, we must show our work, which in short means regular Git commits.
