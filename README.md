## Summary

Do it right this time. Unemployment is a fate worse than death, and it can only be remediated by the proper contextualisation of marketable skills, as well as application to the task of staying abrest of market trends and directions.

### Problem

Unemployment is a fate worse than death, that lacks both social and fiscal credit. Never be more talented than what the market can bear, and always be ready to go with what is current, rather than what you think you are good at. 

The more niche your previous role, the greater danger you are in.
