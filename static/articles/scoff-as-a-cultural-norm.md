## Scoff as a cultural norm

07 SEP 2025

### Backout Clause

There are many for whom scoff is a cultural norm. Particularly where we live, there is a cultural norm where you can back out of any potential transaction by scoffing at the article as being overvalued, to expensive, common, etc. It has been my observation that scoff in particular takes place in the context of no eye contact. The other person does not scoff at the item, and then look you in the eyes and offer you the opportunity to counter their argument. But rather they scoff, utter a disparagement, then walk away without making eye contact. 

### Impose Social Distance

I reckon the function of scoff is to introduce a social delta, and represent said delta as insurmountable. So as to say, "Where I stand and were you stand are too far apart for us to ever be on the same level."

There is a temptation to think of scoff is an act of cowardice. However because it is a cultural norm, there was a certain sense that it is allowed -- maybe even anticipated -- behavior. Rather than saying, "I'm not interested", you say,"This is not an interesting thing."

### The Lesson of Scoff

And the lesson of the scoff, is to not take it personally, but rather to take it as a window into the world of the person doing the scoffing. They do not have a breadth of cultural literacy that allows them to withdraw from a transaction on equal terms, and in a certain sense that evidences their fear, and their sense of a lack of options, a collapsing worldview where being locked into an unwanted transaction is a very real, very dangerous possibility.

The fox scoffed at the grapes which he could not reach saying, they were probably sour anyway.
